# Overview
The kube-mcp project is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to integrate Kubernetes cluster debugging capabilities directly into the Cursor IDE. It bridges the gap between IDE-based development and Kubernetes cluster management by providing real-time cluster analysis and debugging through LLM-powered insights. The server enables developers to troubleshoot Kubernetes issues without leaving their development environment, leveraging Cursor's AI capabilities to provide intelligent analysis and recommendations.

# Core Features
## 1. Kubernetes Context Integration
- Automatically detects and uses the current kubectl context
- Provides seamless switching between different Kubernetes clusters
- Maintains secure connection to clusters using existing kubeconfig

## 2. Cluster Information Retrieval
- List and describe pods, services, deployments, and other resources
- Fetch logs from containers
- Display resource status and events
- Show resource specifications and configurations

## 3. Real-time Monitoring and Analysis
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Track pod health and status changes
- Analyze application performance metrics
- Detect anomalies and potential issues

## 4. LLM-Powered Debugging Assistant
- Intelligent log analysis to identify errors and patterns
- Root cause analysis for common Kubernetes issues
- Suggested fixes and best practices
- Context-aware recommendations based on cluster state

## 5. Interactive Troubleshooting Tools
- Execute kubectl commands through MCP
- Port forwarding for debugging services
- Shell access to containers (when appropriate)
- Resource editing capabilities with validation

# User Experience
## User Personas
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need quick access to cluster information while writing infrastructure code
- **Application Developers**: Want to debug their applications running in Kubernetes without deep K8s knowledge
- **Platform Engineers**: Require advanced debugging capabilities with AI-assisted analysis

## Key User Flows
1. **Quick Diagnostics**: Developer notices application issues → Opens Cursor → Uses MCP to analyze pod logs → Gets AI-powered insights → Implements fix
2. **Resource Investigation**: Engineer needs to check deployment status → Queries resources through MCP → Reviews configurations → Makes necessary adjustments
3. **Troubleshooting Session**: Team encounters cluster issues → Uses MCP for comprehensive analysis → AI suggests potential causes → Team resolves issues efficiently

## UI/UX Considerations
- Simple natural language queries for Kubernetes operations
- Clear, formatted output for cluster information
- Inline code suggestions for fixes
- Non-intrusive error handling and notifications
